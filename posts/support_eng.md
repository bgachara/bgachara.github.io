## Musings

- The support role is on both sides, support the users of the software product as per their/organisation needs and also support the product engineers interface with the users by providing them with actionable points on the use.
- Always touch base on how a particular problem was solved and document if possible to aid in the iteration/ reoccurence of the problem.
- Always reproduce the error with the system user whenever possible to get an idea of how they did it.
- Encourage good design practices on side of developers, i.e good error messages, to aid system users
- Set up detailed and clear monitoring, performance metrics and error rates.
- Good documentation and an easy-to-understand operational model.
