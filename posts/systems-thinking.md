- Much of the art of system dynamics modeling is discovering and representing the feedback processes which along with stocks and flows structures, time delays and
  nonlinearities, determine the dynamics of the system.
- The fundamental principle of ystem dynamics states that the structure of the system gives rise to its behaviour,the lack of this leads to the fundamental attribution error.

## Need for system dynamics simulation model

- Increase our understanding of the problem.
- Improve existing systems.
- Improve behaviours
- Reduce complexity.
- Avoid black-box decision making. 
- Get qualified answers - Reduce cost - Save time.

## Preparation for system dynamics simulation

- Problem definition: Formulating a problem from a dynamic perspective.
- Key variables: Recognising central factors and key variables.
- Behaviour over time: Recognising and estimating the behaviour of key varibales over time.
- Feedback diagrams: Identifying cause and effect, drawing feedback diagrams.

## Process of system dynamics simulation

- Stock and flow diagrams: Identification of stocks ad flows in the system.
- Model equations: Integrations for stocks and Policies for flows.
- Simulation: Generate model behaviour over time.(5-6 tests)
- Analysis and Implementation: Compare real and simulated behaviour, test structure, identify and test policy alternatives, implement changes in the real system.

- Look into Powersim Studio 10.
