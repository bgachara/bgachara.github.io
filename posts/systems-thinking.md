- Much of the art of system dynamics modeling is discovering and representing the feedback processes which along with stocks and flows structures, time delays and
  nonlinearities, determine the dynamics of the system.
- The fundamental principle of system dynamics states that the structure of the system gives rise to its behaviour,the lack of this leads to the fundamental attribution error.
- Dynamics: This is the subject that deals with change, with systems that evolve in time, whether the system settles in equilibrium, keeps repeating in cycles or does something more complicated.
- Data-driven discovery on systems that typically nonlinear, dynamic, multi-scale in space and time and high-dimensional with dominant underlying patterns that should be characterized
  and modeled for the eventual gola of sensing, prediction, estimation and control.
- Many complex systems exhibit dominant low-dimensional patterns in the data, despite rapidly increasing resolution of measurements and computations, this underlying structure enables
  efficient sensing and compact representations for modeling and control.
- Pattern extraction can be defined as finding coordinate transforms that simplify the system.

## Need for system dynamics simulation model

- Increase our understanding of the problem.
- Improve existing systems.
- Improve behaviours
- Reduce complexity.
- Avoid black-box decision making. 
- Get qualified answers - Reduce cost - Save time.

## Preparation for system dynamics simulation

- Problem definition: Formulating a problem from a dynamic perspective.
- Key variables: Recognising central factors and key variables.
- Behaviour over time: Recognising and estimating the behaviour of key varibales over time.
- Feedback diagrams: Identifying cause and effect, drawing feedback diagrams.

## Process of system dynamics simulation

- Stock and flow diagrams: Identification of stocks ad flows in the system.
- Model equations: Integrations for stocks and Policies for flows.
- Simulation: Generate model behaviour over time.(5-6 tests)
- Analysis and Implementation: Compare real and simulated behaviour, test structure, identify and test policy alternatives, implement changes in the real system.

- Look into Powersim Studio 10.
